### Why do we need the Lagrangian equation?

1. Newtonâ€™s mechanics become increasingly complex when dealing with systems that involve constraints or generalized coordinates.  
2. The Lagrangian formulation simplifies such systems by focusing on scalar quantities like energy instead of vector forces, making the mathematics more elegant and manageable.
